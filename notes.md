# LOOPS AND TURTLES
## There are two esssential parts of a loop
* What is the task that is being repeated? Eg. print a number
* What is the data set to be used with the task? Eg. use numbers 1-100
## For loops
* Allows us to repeat a section of code a _specific number of times_
* For **variable iterator** in **list**: _followed by indented loop body_
* _A good naming convention_ pluralize the list and singularize a the individual values
## Functions!
* syntax is as follows: def **my-function** ( parameters ): _followed by function body_
## Use is_ naming convention for functions that return boolean values!
